### Class Selector
In CSS, any class declared in HTML can be selected for adding some CSS designs using . (dot) before classname and add desigs within curly braces.
For example: section of <b>abc.html</b> file as follows:
 ```
 <body>
  <p class="first">This is a paragraph.</p>
 </body>
 ```

section of <b>index.css</b> file (i.e. related to abc.html) as follows:
```
 .first{
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic;
  }
```
outputs:
<p><b><i>This is a paragraph.</i></b></p>
