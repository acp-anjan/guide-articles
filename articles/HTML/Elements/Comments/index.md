title: Comments
---
Comment is used for coders' reference to acknowledge the purpose of certain code in specific position. In HTML, comment is placed within the &lt;!-- <italics>Comments Here</italics> --&gt; The text between these tags/encodings is ignored by HTML. It is a good practice to do comment in coding for future references.
 <br>
 For example:
 <pre>
 <code>
    &lt;!-- <italics>Comments Here</italics> --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    Introduction to comments in HTML...
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  </code>
  
  The output is like this:
  <pre>
  <code>
  Introduction to comments in HTML...
  </pre>
  </code>
It means that comment is not displayed in the webpage. It is only visible to the html document for only the coders' reference.
