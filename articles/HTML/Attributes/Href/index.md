## Href
The <code>href</code> has the path to new links. The new links may be the next page of the website or some section of the same page with in it.
If we want to reference some new page, it can be done as:
```
<a href="../firstpage.html">Go to first page</a>
```
However, if we want no any referencing, we can use <code>#</code> for dead link.
```
<a href="#">Dead link</a>
```
Similarly, If we wish to link to some section of same page, we can reference it by using id following the #.
```
<a href="#section-features">Features</a>
```
where, <code>section-features</code> is the id of some section within same webpage.
