Required is an important attribute within &lt;input&gt; tag. When a specific input is really important for the submission of form, this attribute is used. For example: for login page email and password is really important for the submission. So in those input tags required is used.
<pre>
<code>
&lt;form action="../action_page.php"&gt;
  Username: &lt;input type="text" name="usrname" <strong>required</strong>&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>
</pre>
